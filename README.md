## About
Using an exercise API, we are creating a website app for tracking your progress in the gym and creating a program, called myGainz. This app will contain a workout routine using pre-existing workouts or custom workouts. You will be able to track weight/reps for each workout which saves as progress, notify friends if you hit a personal record, and able to lookup new workouts and be shown a gif of how to do it. This project was created for CMSI 2021 Website Application Development, Fall 2022, Homework #4.

## Work Breakdown
We will overview the whole project and separate each part and distribute evenly between each person. If somebody needs help, for example on a firestore, then we can have somebody else join in. Maybe separating each language for whoever is best with that language. Everyone chipping in on different parts or features to make the site whole. 

## User Needs
This web app appeals to all who workout. For those with less experience in the gym, there are preset programs to follow and information on each exercise such as equipment needed, muscles that it hits, and a little clip to show to perform the exercise. You can also create your own program or change an existing program that appeals to your needs and the equipment available to you. These programs are easy to follow and track your progress as you workout. 

## Technologies Used
- React & React Router
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS & Tailwind
- APIs: ExerciseDB & Type Fit
- Firebase & Firestore

## Challenges and Future Plans
Some challenges we had were setting up firebase to handle user-specific data, which we solved by having a user collection which contains a personalized document for each user. Some future plans for “myGainz” might include adding a future plan program with charts and other stuff where you can visualize your project and allow users to create custom routines or splits, just making it more customizable. Maybe even a diet system of sorts that you can track or build yourself. Overall, after going through some challenges with myGainz the app looks great and the future looks promising for this web app.

## Special Shoutout
For myGainz web app, we would like to give a special thanks to Maddie McDowell's mom. She created the awesome logo for our web app that really tied together the visuals, css, & colors of it all.
