## About
Using an exercise API, we are creating a website app for tracking your progress in the gym and creating a program. This app will contain a workout routine using pre-existing workouts or custom workouts. You will be able to track weight/reps for each workout which saves as progress, notify friends if you hit a personal record, and able to lookup new workouts and be shown a gif of how to do it. 

## Work Breakdown
We will overview the whole project and separate each part and distribute evenly between each person. If somebody needs help, for example on a firestore, then we can have somebody else join in. Maybe separating each language for whoever is best with that language. Everyone chipping in on different parts or features to make the site whole.
